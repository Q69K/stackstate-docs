# Perspectives

StackState and its [4T data model](../../concepts/4t_data_model.md) collect real-time data about your IT landscape. **Perspectives** allow you to look at this data from various angles and to relate different types of data to each other.

All data in StackState is organized around [topology](../../concepts/4t_data_model.md#topology), a representation of the components and their relations that make up your IT landscape. A subset of that topology, called a [view](topology-perspective/views.md), that represents the application, layer or set of components that you care about, is the context that the perspectives operate in.

### Perspectives

StackState offers the following perspectives via it's user interface:

* [Topology perspective](topology-perspective/)
* [Telemetry perspective](telemetry-perspective/)
* [Event perspective](event-perspective.md)

### Time travel

All perspectives allow for time travel by using the timeline control located at the bottom of the perspective.
